RenderBody: is used for rendering the content of the child view. In layout pages, it renders the portion of a content page. 
			It takes the content of the child page and merges into the layout.

Partial view: in ASP.NET MVC is a special view that renders a portion of view content. It is just like a user control of a web form application. 
			  Partial can be reusable in multiple views. It helps us to reduce code duplication. In other word a partial view enables us to render a view within the parent view.

Data Annotations: are nothing but certain validations that we put in our models to validate the input from the user.
				System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations: Key, Timestamp, ConcurrencyCheck, Required, MinLength, MaxLength, StringLength, bind, range, RegularExpression, DisplayName
				System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema: Table, Column, Index, ForeignKey, NotMapped, InverseProperty


Dependency injection: 
1. Transient: new service - every time requested
	1. 
2. Singleton : new service - once per request (Still page not reload)
3. Scoped: new service - once per application lifetime


Note: Avoid using viewbag and viewdata as they are not dynamic and only bind with model (that model surely used in many files) and leading to misunderstandings about the source of data.
		instead of use viewModel. alternative is tightly bind your view with the object of you want.
